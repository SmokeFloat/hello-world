### Hello World!

As of 29 July 2022, I am an aspiring 18-year-old on his way to become a full stack web developer.

I've had experience with playing around HTML, CSS, and JS during my high school days. I self-learned them mainly from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). I created a basic webpage with fully-functional calculators of measures of descriptive statistics as my final project for my ICT class. I am proud of it and is looking to recreate it with upgrades such as fixes to floating point errors and making it responsive to different resolutions.

I'm looking to build up my tech stack and hope that, by the end of the year, I will be proficient enough in FrontEnd UI frameworks.
